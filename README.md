# nbody gravity simulation
Simple c project to familiarise myself with the language. This project uses raylib and the standard library for a pretty robust simulation of our solar system.

## controls
- Drag the mouse to move
- Scroll to zoom
- use square brackets ('\[' and '\]') to speed up and slow down time
